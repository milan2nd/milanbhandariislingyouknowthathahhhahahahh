        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. The story revolves around Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The manga was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, "Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump" from 1999 to 2014, and was later adapted into an anime television series.

        <h2>The Story</h2>
        <p>
          The story of Naruto is divided into two parts: the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. The series starts with the attack of the Nine-Tails, a powerful fox demon, on the Hidden Leaf Village. To save the village, the Fourth Hokage seals the demon inside the newborn Naruto, causing him to be shunned by the villagers. Naruto grows up with the dream of becoming Hokage to gain the villagers' respect and acceptance.

          Throughout the series, Naruto forms close bonds with his friends and mentors, especially with Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno, his teammates in Team 7. Naruto's journey is filled with numerous challenges and battles against powerful enemies. Despite the hardships, Naruto's determination and optimism never waver.
