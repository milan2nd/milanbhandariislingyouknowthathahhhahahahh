      <section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          C is a high-level programming language that was developed by Dennis Ritchie between 1969 and 1973 at Bell Labs. It is widely used for system programming and embedded systems due to its efficiency and control. C is known for its powerful features and flexibility, allowing programmers to write complex programs while maintaining performance.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The C language was developed as an evolution of the B language, which itself was derived from BCPL. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler, which made it a popular choice for developing operating systems and other critical software. The language has undergone several revisions, with the most significant being ANSI C and ISO C standards.

        <h2>Syntax and Structure</h2>
        <p>
          C syntax is concise and provides a rich set of operators and control structures. Here are some key elements of C syntax:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> C supports various data types such as int, float, char, and double. Variables must be declared before use.</li>
          <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> C includes control structures like if, else, switch, for, while, and do-while to manage the flow of the program.</li>
          <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Functions are a fundamental part of C. They allow code to be organized into reusable blocks.</li>
          <li><strong>Pointers:</strong> Pointers in C are variables that store memory addresses. They provide low-level memory manipulation capabilities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>
          Despite its strengths, C programming comes with its own set of challenges:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> C requires explicit memory management, which can lead to issues such as memory leaks and pointer errors if not handled properly.</li>
          <li><strong>Complex Syntax:</strong> The syntax of C can be complex and difficult for beginners to master, particularly when dealing with pointers and memory allocation.</li>
          <li><strong>Lack of Modern Features:</strong> Compared to modern languages, C lacks some built-in features and abstractions that facilitate easier and safer programming.</li>
          <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> C does not have built-in error handling mechanisms like exceptions, which can make it harder to manage errors in larger programs.</li>
        </ul>
