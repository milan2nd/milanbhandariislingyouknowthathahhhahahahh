          Demon Slayer season 4 has finally concluded and it has been an incredible journey so far. Given how the Swordsmith Village arc was animated, fans were a little doubtful going into the Hashira Training arc. But Ufotable did a stellar job with the plethora of anime-original scenes and injected life into the arc.<br><br>
          Kagaya Ubuyashiki received a decent amount of screen time in the series. The last episode revealed Kagaya Ubuyashiki’s fate in the series, and fans were sad to bid adieu to this incredible character. Ubuyashiki, alongside his wife, and two of his daughters, were dead by the end of the episode.However, this was a move that was initiated by Ubuyashiki himself. This led to an interesting question that was posed on various platforms - Why did he let his daughters die in Demon Slayer? To get some clarity on this matter, one can look into chapter 144 of the manga series. Nichika and Hinaki willingly refused to leave their father’s side in his final moments.

          Kagaya Ubuyashiki, his wife, and two daughters blew themselves up when Muzan made an appearance. This was all a part of Ubuyashiki’s plan.In chapter 144 of the manga series, it was revealed that his two daughters, Hinaki and Nichika, didn't want to leave their father alone. Much like the duo, Amane Ubuyashiki too refused to leave her husband’s side. The entire family showed incredible grit and courage throughout that interaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the anime-only fans don’t know is that Ubuyashiki had 5 children. Two daughters and his only son are still alive in the anime series because they weren’t present at his quarters when the explosion took place. Kiriya, Kuina, and Kanata are alive in the anime series. In fact, Kiriya Ubuyashiki will be the leader of the Corps’ as soon as the Infinity Castle arc commences.

        </p>
        <p>
          Kiriya is an exceptionally important character in the series. While he might not be able to fight on the front lines, the importance of his help in the upcoming arc cannot be overstated. The final episode of season 4 ended with the demon hunters and Hashira falling into the Infinity Castle. This is a building that constantly changes its layout all thanks to Nakime’s abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kiriya Ubuyashiki, along with Kuina and Kanata, help the demon hunters navigate through this labyrinth where demons are lurking at every corner. The members of the Ubuyashiki clan also have a unique ability to assign just the right amount of manpower to any threat they perceive.
        </p>
        <p>
          In conclusion, Kagaya Ubuyashiki didn’t let his daughters die. Nichika and Hinaki wanted to stay next to their father in his last moments. Kagaya was someone who had the utmost empathy for his dear ones and he would never ask his daughters to die for his cause. In fact, their love for him even during his final moments shows just how much he was respected and loved by those who were around him.
